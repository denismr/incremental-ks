# Incremental Kolmogorov Smirnov

Implementations for the Incremental Kolmogorov Smirnov algorithm.
As a side-effect, this repository also provides implementations for Treap with Lazy Propagation.

## Current Supported Languages

- [X] ***pure* Lua** (although the code is pure-Lua, Luajit is required to achieve reasonable performance)
- [X] ***pure* Python** (should be avoided. Terrible performance)
- [X] **C++**
- [X] **C wrapper for C++** (ideal for FFI)
- [X] **Lua** (FFI Version, backed by C++ Version)
- [X] **Python** (FFI Version, backed by C++ Version)

## TO DO List:

- code examples for sliding window
- code the algorithm in other languages
